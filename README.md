## My process

### 💡 Built with

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the visual elements and layout of the web page, ensuring a visually appealing design.
- JavaScript: Used for implementing interactive features and dynamic behavior, such as displaying article previews and handling user interactions.

### 🧠 What I learned

While working on the Article Preview Page project, I gained valuable experience and learned several key concepts, including:
- Responsive Design Principles: I learned how to create a responsive web design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices using CSS media queries. This helped me ensure that the article previews are displayed optimally on various devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.
- CSS Styling Techniques: I learned advanced CSS styling techniques to enhance the visual appeal of the article previews, such as using flexbox or grid layouts for better alignment and spacing, and applying hover effects to make the previews more interactive.
- JavaScript DOM Manipulation: I deepened my understanding of JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) by implementing interactive features and dynamic behavior on the article preview page. This included dynamically generating HTML elements, handling user interactions, and updating the page content dynamically without requiring a full page refresh.
- User Experience (UX) Design: I learned about user experience (UX) design principles and how to apply them to create a user-friendly interface for the article preview page. This involved considering factors such as readability, accessibility, and usability to ensure a positive experience for users interacting with the page.
- Version Control with Git: I gained experience in using version control with Git to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage the project's codebase efficiently. This allowed me to work on different features and experiment with different design ideas while keeping the project organized and maintainable.

Overall, working on the Article Preview Page project provided me with practical experience in front-end web development and helped me sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as gain insights into user experience design principles and version control practices.
